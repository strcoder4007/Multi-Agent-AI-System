Multimodal generative AI models are machine learning models capable of processing and integrating information from multiple modalities or types of data, such as images, videos, audio, text, and more. These models have the potential to revolutionize various fields by enabling natural interactions between users and machines and improving the understanding and generation of outputs across multiple data types.
