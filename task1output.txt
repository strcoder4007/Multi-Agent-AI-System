## Mycelium Colonization Time: Insights from r/MushroomGrowers and r/psilocybingrowers

Here's a breakdown of the information gathered on mycelium colonization time from the two subreddits:

**r/MushroomGrowers:**

* **General Timeframe:** Most users report seeing signs of colonization within 7 days, with some observing growth as early as 2-3 days.
* **Factors Affecting Colonization Speed:**
    * **Inoculation Method:** Liquid culture is generally faster than spore syringes.
    * **Spawn Substrate:** Different substrates can lead to varying colonization times.
    * **Temperature and Humidity:** Optimal conditions are crucial for fast growth.
* **Techniques to Speed Up Colonization:**
    * **Break and Shake:** Mixing the mycelium at around 10-20% and 30% colonization can accelerate the process.
    * **Direct to Fruiting:** Some users recommend skipping grain spawn and going directly to fruiting substrate for faster results, particularly with certain strains like Stargazer.

**r/psilocybingrowers:**

* **Average Colonization Time:** Users often mention a timeframe of 2-3 weeks for full grain jar colonization.
* **Break and Shake:** Similar to r/MushroomGrowers, shaking the jars at around 50% colonization is a common practice.
* **Over Colonization:** Some discussions warn against letting the mycelium colonize for too long, as it can negatively impact pinning and increase the risk of contamination.

**Recurring Themes:**

* **Patience is Key:** Both subreddits emphasize the importance of patience, as rushing the process can lead to contamination or other issues.
* **Environmental Factors:** Maintaining proper temperature and humidity is crucial for optimal colonization.
* **Break and Shake:** This technique is widely recommended for speeding up colonization.

**Outliers:**

* While most users report colonization times within the expected range, there are occasional outliers with significantly longer or shorter durations. These cases often involve unique strains, environmental factors, or contamination issues.

**Conclusion:**

Mycelium colonization time can vary depending on several factors, but generally falls within 1-3 weeks. Using techniques like break and shake and maintaining optimal growing conditions can help speed up the process. However, patience is crucial, and rushing can lead to problems.
