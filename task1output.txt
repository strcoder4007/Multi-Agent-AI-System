To check and remove ticks on dogs, first inspect your dog regularly for ticks. If you find a tick, use gloves and avoid crushing it. Use a tick remover tool or fine-tipped tweezers to gently pull the tick straight out without twisting. Dispose of the tick in a sealed container filled with rubbing alcohol or soap and water. Lastly, watch for any signs of infection or discomfort after removing the tick, and consult a veterinarian if necessary.
